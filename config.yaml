# Chunking
txt_chunk_chars: 6500   # chunk size for plain text (TXT)

# Number of characters from the END of the previous chunk passed to the model as READ-ONLY CONTEXT.
# Improves continuity; not included in output. Typical: 300–800 (0 = off).

# Overlap enable/disable

# Join-time window (in characters) used to remove any DUPLICATED prefix from the next chunk’s output.
# Usually set equal to txt_overlap_chars; increase if you still see duplicates.
# Try null, but can be completely disabled by setting 0

# Content optimization mode:
# - normal   : balanced cleanup (default). Keeps meaning; light structure.
# - strict   : no reordering; only punctuation/casing; remove safe fillers.
# - creative : allows stronger rephrasing/merging short sentences; normalizes term variants.

# If true, these comments are removed from the final Markdown (still accounted internally by the model).

# Allowed values:
# - italic      -> render as italics (*...*)
# - blockquote  -> render as blockquote (> ...)
