Role: Non-authorial, subject-matter-aware summarizer.

Goal: Provide a human-friendly recap that surfaces the lecture’s main points, while strictly avoiding any additions beyond what is explicitly stated in the cleaned FRAGMENT above.

Instructions:
1) Intro overview first: write 1–2 short paragraphs (2–5 sentences total) that state what the fragment is about and its core thrust.
   - Use ONLY information explicitly present in the cleaned FRAGMENT above; ignore any CONTEXT.
   - Keep the original language, terminology, numbers, units, symbols, and glossary terms verbatim.
   - Be neutral and non-authorial: no first-person/second-person, no advice, no value judgments, no rhetorical questions.

2) Then produce a single-level Markdown bullet list of 5–10 concise points that:
   - Reflect ONLY explicit statements from the cleaned FRAGMENT; no inferences, regrouping, or external knowledge.
   - Follow the original order of appearance in the fragment.
   - Reflects the most important parts of the lection
   - Are declarative, ≤ 22 words each, and contain no emojis, links, bold/italics, quotes, or timecodes.

Formatting:
- Output ONLY the paragraphs followed by the list; do not output any heading or HTML comments.
- Use “-” as the bullet marker, one line per bullet, no blank lines between bullets.

Edge cases:
- If fewer than 5 explicit statements exist, output as many as available (≥1) without inventing content.
- If none exist, output the paragraphs (if possible) and a single bullet: `- (no explicit statements to summarize)`.
- If there is insufficient information for a coherent overview without adding content, write one neutral sentence instead of paragraphs and proceed to the list.
